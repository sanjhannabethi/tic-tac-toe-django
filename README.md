# Tic-Tac-Toe using Django

The purpose of this project is to learn the Django framework. I am intentionally picking a simple but non-trivial problem statement which is different from the app that is built in the Django tutorial to make sure I understand how the system works and am not just copy-pasting code.

My app will play tic-tac-toe against the user.
